Commands:
git init - create an initial git repository (at start theres no commit, you have to add your own commit from start)

git status - see what changes are there to your file

git add 'file_name' - this adds your file to the staging area before a commit





Reflections:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when you initilaise the repository then you create the git file. This is where the version control may be stored. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area can offer a waiting place so that any changes or errors can be fixed before a commit. The owrking directory.. lord alone knows and for the repository, well thats where you want fixed stuff chillling.. or stuff you think is fixed, logically.
